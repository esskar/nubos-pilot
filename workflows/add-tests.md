# /np:add-tests

<objective>
After `/np:verify-work` emits VERIFICATION.md with SC classifications,
convert each Pass-SC into a runnable `node:test` case as a UAT regression
suite. User-authored tests outside the `>>> np:add-tests begin … <<< end`
sentinels survive regeneration.
</objective>

## Initialize

```bash
PHASE="$1"
INIT=$(node .nubos-pilot/bin/np-tools.cjs init add-tests init "$PHASE")
```

Parse: `phase`, `target_path`, `verification_path`, `pass_cases[]`,
`skip_cases[]`. Target path is
`<pkgRoot>/test/uat/phase-<padded>-<slug>.test.cjs`.

## Execution

Emit/merge the Sentinel block:

```bash
node .nubos-pilot/bin/np-tools.cjs init add-tests emit "$PHASE"
```

Smoke-run the generated file to catch syntax errors early:

```bash
node --test "$(echo "$INIT" | node -e "process.stdin.on('data', d => console.log(JSON.parse(d).target_path))")"
```

## Critic review (tests-axis focused)

Once the UAT file is emitted and the smoke-run is green, the orchestrator spawns ONE `np-critic` instance (ADR-0010) with the rendered UAT file + the milestone's `M<NNN>-VERIFICATION.md` as inputs. Although `np-critic` covers all three axes, the prompt for this invocation should weight the tests-axis (verify-mismatch, missing-test, weak-assertion, etc.) since the deliverable is the test surface. The critic verifies:

- Every Pass-case in `VERIFICATION.md` has a corresponding test in the UAT file.
- Every test name describes observable behaviour.
- No `test.skip(...)` without a corresponding Fail / Defer marker.
- No vacuous assertions.

Findings of category `missing-test`, `weak-assertion`, `silenced-failure`, or `verify-mismatch` route per `lib/nubosloop.cjs::routeFindings`. A single Build-Fixer-style round on `init add-tests` closes the loop. Beyond one round the workflow exits non-zero and the user resolves manually.

This is intentionally a one-pass adversarial review (not the full Critic-Schwarm) — the UAT-emitter is mechanical and only one axis (test quality) needs adversarial coverage.

## Meta-commit

UAT tests are a PHASE artifact, not a TASK artifact, so ADR-0004
atomic-per-task does not apply — per D-19 this is a phase-level meta
commit. Scope it tightly to the UAT file only (never `git add .`):

```bash
TARGET=$(echo "$INIT" | node -e "process.stdin.on('data', d => console.log(JSON.parse(d).target_path))")
git add "$TARGET"
git commit -m "docs(${PHASE}): persist UAT from verification"
```

## Scope Guardrail

**Do:**
- Render only the sentinel-bounded block; preserve everything outside.
- Use `test.skip(..., { todo: ... })` for Fail/Defer cases so the suite
  tracks them without failing CI.
- `git add <target>` — single explicit path.

**Don't:**
- Overwrite user-authored tests outside the sentinels.
- Commit the VERIFICATION.md and the UAT file together (separate commits;
  VERIFICATION.md is committed by `/np:verify-work`).

## Output

- `test/uat/phase-<padded>-<slug>.test.cjs` with the sentinel-bounded
  block updated.
- Meta-commit `docs(<padded>): persist UAT from verification`.
## Definition of Done

This workflow exits successfully only when, per [`templates/COMPLETENESS.md`](../templates/COMPLETENESS.md):

- Rule 3 (Do it with tests) — every persisted Pass-case becomes a `node:test` UAT that runs in CI; no skipped or commented-out asserts.
- Rule 5 (Genuinely impress) — UAT names describe observable behaviour, not implementation incidentals.
- Rule 11 (Ship the complete thing) — every Pass-case from VERIFICATION emerges as a runnable test, none deferred.
- Rule 12 (Boil the ocean) — partial coverage exits non-zero; the workflow does not silently skip cases.

Any violation = workflow exits non-zero. The orchestrator does not relax these.
